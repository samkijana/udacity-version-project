## Description
Use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
1. Chicago
2. New York City
3. Washington

Code will import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

Data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

Statistics to be computed in bikeshare.py will provide the following information:
1. Popular times of travel 
   - most common month
   - most common day of week
   - most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
   - most common start station
   - most common end station
   - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
   - total travel time
   - average travel time

4. User info
   - counts of each user type
   - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
   - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
